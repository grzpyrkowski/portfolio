# Portfolio - client-side

This part of [portfolio](https://github.com/grzpyrkowski/portfolio-test) is User Interface of application.

---

## Open the App in web browser

Open terminal and type \
npm start \
to download all libraries and start the app.

## Content description

Every next tab, starting from landing page, is a bit more complex. It kinda shows my learning process.

### CV

Portfolios landing page is my CV.

### Shop

Shop tab contains fetched products with option of filtering them.

### Game

Game tab contains simple memo game.

### Board

Last tab, the most complex one, contains to-do board with all CRUD operations. \
Those are implemented in the use of redux, async thunk and axios. \
To see functionalities you need to start the [server](../portfolio-api/README.md).

## Further progress

Application is far from finished, same as my learning process. There are plenty of things needing improvement but at first I would like to focus on:
- [x] Fix CRUD
- [x] Routes with React Router
- [ ] Add form validation
- [ ] Better understand of Redux
- [ ] CSS preprocessing
- [ ] Implement CSS framework (surely Tailwind CSS)
- [ ] Make it responsive
- [ ] Testing (Jest, Cypress, React Testing Library)
