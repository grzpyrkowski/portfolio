## Open the App in web browser

Open terminal and type \

## Content description

Every next tab, starting from landing page, is a bit more complex. It kinda shows my learning process.

### Shop

Shop tab contains fetched products with option of filtering them.

### Game

Game tab contains simple memo game.

### Board

Last tab, the most complex one, contains to-do board with all CRUD operations. \
Those are implemented in the use of redux, async thunk and axios. \
To see functionalities you need to start the [server](../portfolio-api/README.md).
