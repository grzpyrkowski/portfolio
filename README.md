# Portfolio

This is the oldest of my projects. \
Purpose of creating it was basicaly learn some JS and React, being able to set the server-client environment and have some fun with HTML and CSS. \
This project is divided to client-side and API-side. \
To use all the functionalities you have to open them separately and run provided commands. \
Check README attached to each folder.
